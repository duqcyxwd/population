#Population 

This is a program to find how many zip codes exist in the United States by using the zipcode database from the [Federal Government Zip Codes](http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/)

1. `area.rb` is a class to represent each of the locations within the csv.

2. `csv_reader.rb` will read the `csv` file and return a hash object for each of the rows in the `csv` file.

3. `setup.rb` calls the `CSVReader` class and creates an `Area` instance for each row.

4. `analytics.rb` performs various queries on the data.

5. `population.rb` is the main menu for the application.
